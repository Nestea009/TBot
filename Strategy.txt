New Strat: Highest Highs and Lowest Lows

We cannot perfectly describe a low point, so:

0. If we buy and instantly start falling, wait some time, if we're still loosing:
  a) Set a new floor and lose that bit of money (great fall could be ahead, and we would lose a lot of money)
  b) Sell, and wait for a rise to buy (not sustainable, perpetual loss possible)
  But if we're suddenly rising, leave it.

Having entered the market correctly on an uptrend: 

- Note: Our Lowest Low isn't supposed to change, it is what it's set to be

1. Buy at a low point and mark it as the lowest low (with the previous problem)

2. Wait for a Highest High and mark it as such

3. Get the difference between the lowest low and the highest High; that's our window,

Sell (on a benefit) if: 

  a) We go below 60% of the window (to be adjusted)
  b) We go above 150%, WAIT FOR A FALL (to be adjusted)

Problem: We cannot determine when to start buying
Solution: Learn to determine a rising pattern

- A rising trend is defined as a series of highs and lows that are 
higher than the last high and the last low. The trend continues if the 
previous condition is met, but will fail to do so as soon as a 
new high doesn't go higher than the previous. Note: a lower low doesn't affect
the trend unless it goes too far down (unlikely).

- This definition won't give us a clear idea of when to buy and sell, 
because that's what our strategy does, this definition will 
give us a clear understanding of when to buy with a clear view 
towards an uptrend. :)

Algorithmic Solution: Wait for a low, a high, a new low and a new high. If
the conditions are such of an uptrend, buy, if they're not, repeat. 

- Our Window will be defined as the interval between a lowest low and a 
highest high. Our strategy will take advantage of this window so that if 
the price falls below 50% (adjustable) of the maximum profit (aka, the window)
we sell at a Minimum Win. However, if instead of passing below 50% we go above 
125% (also adjustable) we will change the window to the new highest high and 
the price sell limit to 90% instead of 50%. 
(Note that the highest high will always be renewed if the price goes up
until it reaches 125% of the initial highest high)

Problem: Finding a Highest High

- Besides a highest high being easily defined, it is hard to 
determine when one has happened via numbers. If we define it 
as a fall from the previous price we risk perpetual loss.
(It could lose at a slower rate than we need to say that 
a highest high has happened)
But if we define it according to the Lowest Low, 
it's possible that we never reach the high point 
set as a minnimum or even lose money without ever 
getting to the minnimum either. 

Solution: You dumb bitch, we don't need to sell: 
A highest high is just the highest point until now.

def FindHighestHigh():
  #Find 5 values without loosing 15% of the Lowest Low and the highest will be the initial highest high. 
  initial_highest_high = (highest value)
  return initial_highest_high

last_highest_high = FindHighestHigh()

if (actual_price > last_highest_high) and (actual_price !> (initial_highest_high * 1.25)):
  last_highest_high = actual_price 
elif actual_price > (initial_highest_high * 1.25)
  higher_high = actual price 

window = last_highest_high - lowest_low

if actual_price < (lowest_low * 0.9):
  PlaceSellAPPL()
  print ("Sold at a loss")
